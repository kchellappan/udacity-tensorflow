# udacity-tensorflow
My assignment submissions for the Udacity Tensorflow course (taken in Feb 2016).
The code in the ipython notebooks (ipython_notebooks) is incomplete, mostly because running the ipython notebook server on my laptop increased processing time, and frequently caused crashes.

The completed code for the assignments is in the python_scripts folder (running code through the interpreter was much faster on my older machine).
